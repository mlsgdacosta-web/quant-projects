# Monte Carlo Simulation Engine

This repository implements a modular Monte Carlo simulation engine for a range of
stochastic processes commonly used in quantitative finance, probability theory, and
stochastic modeling.

## Features

- Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
- Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) Process
- Random Walks
- Jump-Diffusion (Poisson Jumps)
- Discrete-Time Markov Chains

## Variance Reduction Techniques

- Antithetic Variates
- Stratified Sampling
- Control Variates

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example
See `simulations/gbm.py` for a simple GBM simulator.
